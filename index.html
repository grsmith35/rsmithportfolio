                <p>
                    My name is Riley Smith and I am from Utah. Born in Arizona but grew up in Utah. I have a 3-year old son named Lincoln
                    who can't hold still to save his life. I am engaged to get married in May of 2022. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy pretty much anything active, working out, mountain biking, hiking, camping, and playing with my son or dogs are among my favorite things. 
                </p>
                    I have always been drawn to computers. I started playing computer games from a very young age. I got my degree in 
                    management of information systems and technology. I have worked in IT for the last 5 years. I have done project management, technical services, 
                    and done a bit of python coding to help make our company more efficient. I was always most excited for the coding part of my job and that made me 
                    want to join the U of U coding bootcamp so I could do this everyday. There is something exilarating about designing, researching and building something 
                    then watching it come to life. I am passionate about what I do and never like to half ass anything.
